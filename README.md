Finding the biggest square avoiding obstacles

A file with map is to be passed as argument.
First line should have the number of lines in the map, sign of empty cage, sign of obstacle and sign of full cage.
For example, "9.ox" means that the map contains 9 lines, "." - empty, "o" - obstacle, "x" - full.

There is also mapgenerator and makefile :3
Have fun!
